# Pisible
Pisible is a tool for automatically building Raspberry Pi OS.
Respect [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

# Roadmap
1. Automatically build an image of the Raspberry Pi OS by modifying a simple config file.
2. Automatically build an image with dependent libraries installed using ansible.
3. Develop a mechanism to automatically build a running RaspberryPi based on a config file placed on the server.
